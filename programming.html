    Cyber Intelligence is a game I made for Cyberpunk Jam 007 on itch.io

    <p id="c_int_p1">It's a short game about being a stealthy assassin and taking out guards to retrieve data from a computer terminal</p>

    <p>Due to time constraints and me developing solo, the game is a bit buggy. Especially the enemy behavior is very jank. It was my first time experimenting with NPC behavior and using</p>

    <p>You can play it <a href="https://makq.itch.io/cyber-intelligence" target="_blank">here</a> if you'd like</p>

    <p>All level design, programming and music was done by me on this project. I didn't have enough time to make my own props so most of the visual assets are not created by me</p>

    Doobobulatron is a game me and my team of 6 worked on for the GDK Space jam 25

    <p id="c_int_p1">It's a puzzle game about being on a decaying space ship that you need to save. The way tos save the ship is activating different terminals around the ship, while avoiding things that come in your way.</p>

    <p>I did all level design and some scripting for a portion where you have to avoid live wires or else they will kill you.</p>

    <p>You can play it <a href="https://makq.itch.io/doobobulatron" target="_blank">here</a> if you'd like</p>
